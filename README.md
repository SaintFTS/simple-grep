A really simple grep clone made by me in one day. Inspired by a problem that "Rust in Action" book by Tim McNamara reviewed in Rust.

I thought it would be an exciting challenge to make it in C++ and expand a bit to work with files in OS. 
Besides, i knew nothing about working with filetypes header in C++, so it turned out to be a really good practice.

Propose your edits to this code if you want (I ain't really familliar with Github, so idk how it works)

What about rewriting it in Rust now?).
